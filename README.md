#rref t3 app

## Outline
user comes in asked to allow camera, then takes picture.
Then gets rref of the picture.

## Todo

- [ ] make it deploy
- [ ] setup camera
- [ ] setup rref
- [ ] setup ETL from camera => rref mechanic => user eyes
- [ ] make it pretty, if possible


## Notes
Hoping I can finish before the midterm tomorrow, since I will need it to do rref fast, instead of typing on computer.
