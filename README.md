#rref t3 app

## Outline
user comes in asked to allow camera, then takes picture.
Then gets rref of the picture.

## Todo

- [x] make it deploy
- [x] setup camera
- [x] on backcamera for phones
- [x] setup rref
- [x] setup pic to text (tesseract)"not as accurate as I thought it would be"
- [ ] use chatgpt image recognition to get the matrix and chatgpt embedded python complier to do rref
- [ ] make it pretty, if possible


## Notes
Hoping I can finish before the midterm tomorrow, since I will need it to do rref fast, instead of typing on computer to do it.
